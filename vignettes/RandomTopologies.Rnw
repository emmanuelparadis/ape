This document describes how phylogenetic trees are simulated in \ape\
and discusses some issues related to solving multichotomies.

\section{Theoretical Background}

We use here the term \emph{topology} to mean the shape of a tree
without consideration of its branch lengths. The number of possible
topologies for $n$ tips (or leaves), denoted as $N_n$, is notoriously
large. This has been studied by Felsenstein \cite{Felsenstein1978} and
later reviewed in his book \cite{Felsenstein2004}. A particularly
relevant case is that of rooted, binary, labeled trees where the
number of possible topologies is given by the double factorial:

\begin{equation}
N_n=(2n-3)!!=1\times 3\times 5\times\cdots\times 2n-3.\label{eq:dblfact}
\end{equation}

The function \code{howmanytrees} in \ape\ calculates the
number of possible topologies with respect to three criteria: rooted
\textit{vs.}\ unrooted, binary \textit{vs.}\ multichotomous, and
labeled \textit{vs.}\ unlabeled. These three options should make eight
possible cases, but the number of unlabeled topologies can be computed
only for rooted, binary trees, so only five cases are effectively
considered. The returned number is obviously an integer which grows
dramatically with $n$:\footnote{This function is not vectorized, so we
  use here \code{sapply}. We could also use
  \code{Vectorize(howmanytrees)(n)}.}

<<>>=
library(ape)
n <- 1:10
data.frame(N.topo = sapply(n, howmanytrees))
@

\noindent With ten labeled tips, a rooted, binary phylogenetic tree
has more than 34 million possible topologies. Suppose we analyze a
sample of $n=25$ sequences (a very modest sample size in today's
standards), this number would be:

<<>>=
howmanytrees(25)
@

\noindent Imagine we want to print each of these topologies on an A4
paper sheet and arrange them side by side to make a (huge)
poster. This would require (in meters):

<<>>=
howmanytrees(25) * 0.21
@

\noindent The diameter of the observable
Universe\footnote{\texttt{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable\_universe}}
is estimated to be $\approx 8.8\times 10^{26}$~m, so it would not be
wide enough to display our trees.

The number of topologies grows much more gently if they are unlabeled,
but still reaching huge values if $n$ is moderately large:

<<>>=
data.frame(N.topo = sapply(n, howmanytrees, labeled = FALSE))
@
<<>>=
n2 <- c(50, 100, 200)
data.frame(N.topo = sapply(n2, howmanytrees, labeled = FALSE),
           row.names = n2)
@

\noindent The formula is more complicated than for the labeled cases
and is computed by recursion setting $N_1=1$:

\begin{displaymath}
N_n =\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
N_1N_{n-1}+N_2N_{n-2}+\dots +\displaystyle\frac{N_{n/2}^2+1}{2}&\quad n\ \mathrm{even}\\[1em]
N_1N_{n-1}+N_2N_{n-2}+\dots +N_{(n-1)/2}N_{(n+1)/2}&\quad n\ \mathrm{odd}\\
\end{array}\right.
\end{displaymath}

These numbers are so large that the probability to randomly
draw twice the same topology when drawing randomly (and independently)
two trees is very close to zero:

<<>>=
1 / howmanytrees(50)
@

\noindent However, for small values of $n$, this is clearly not negligible:

<<>>=
1 / sapply(n, howmanytrees)
@

\noindent These probabilities are of course larger if the topologies are unlabeled:

<<>>=
1 / sapply(n, howmanytrees, labeled = FALSE)
@

\noindent The potential problem is when sampling a large number of
trees, their topologies might not be represented adequately if the
algorithm does not draw them with equal probability.

\phangorn\ has the function \code{allTrees}, but, very wisely, it
accepts only values of $n\le 9$ (or 10 if the trees are unrooted,
which is the default for this function). We consider here $n=4$, so
there are 15 possible labeled topologies and 2 possible unlabeled topologies:

<<>>=
library(phangorn)
TR <- allTrees(4, rooted = TRUE)
TR
@
\setkeys{Gin}{width=\textwidth}
<<fig=true,height=4>>=
layout(matrix(1:15, 3, 5))
par(mar = rep(1.5, 4), xpd = TRUE)
for (i in 1:15) plot(TR[[i]], "c", cex = 1.2, font = 1)
@

\noindent This shows that the two unlabeled topologies do not have the
same number of labeled cases: there are 12 for the unbalanced
topologies, and 3 for the balanced one. Thus, if we
sample the unlabeled topologies with equal probabilities, the labeled
ones will not be represented in equal frequencies. However, we have
seen above that the probability to draw twice the topology is very
small if $n$ is sufficiently large, but this will also depend on the
number of trees samples, denoted here as $K$.

What is the probability $P$ to have at least twice the same unlabeled
topology when drawing $K$ trees assuming equal probability of
sampling?  We have seen above that the probability to draw a specific
topology is the inverse of the possible number of topologies, so the
number of times any topology is drawn out of $K$ draws follows a
binomial distribution with parameters $K$ and $1/N_n$.  The
probability to have at least this topology is one minus the
probability to have it zero time and minus the probability to have it
once. Let's calculate this for $n=50$ and $K=100$:

<<>>=
K <- 100
n <- 50
N <- howmanytrees(n, labeled = FALSE)
p <- 1/N
1 - (dbinom(0, K, p) + dbinom(1, K, p))
@

\noindent These calculations are very close to the numerical precision
of most computers, which may result in (very small) negative
probabilities, for instance, if we omit the parentheses in the last expression:

<<>>=
1 - dbinom(0, K, p) - dbinom(1, K, p)
@

\noindent We now assess these probabilities for a range of values of
$n$ and $K$:

<<fig=true,height=5>>=
f <- function(n, K) {
    N <- howmanytrees(n, labeled = FALSE)
    p <- 1/N
    1 - (dbinom(0, K, p) + dbinom(1, K, p))
}
DF <- expand.grid(n = 4:20, K = c(2, 5, 10, 100, 1e3, 1e4))
DF$P <- mapply(f, n = DF$n, K = DF$K)
library(lattice)
xyplot(P ~ n, DF, groups = K, panel = panel.superpose,
     type = "b", auto.key = list(x = .8, y = .9, title = "K"))
@

\noindent We can print the probabilities for a specific value $n$, or
calculate them for other values of $n$ and $K$:

<<>>=
subset(DF, n == 20)
@
<<>>=
f(20, 1e5)
@
<<>>=
f(30, 1e6)
@

If the number of tips is small ($n<20$), we cannot ignore the
probability to draw more than once the same topology unless a small
number of trees are sampled (e.g., $K<10$ for $n=10$). On the other
hand, if $n\ge 20$ it is unlikely to draw twice the same topology even
when sampling 10,000 trees. We have to keep in mind that these results
were obtained assuming that each unlabeled topology has the same
probability to be sampled.

\section{Simulating Trees with \ape}

There are five functions to simulate trees in \ape~5.4:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \code{rtree}&random topology with fixed $n$ and
                  random branch lengths\\
    \code{rcoal}&random coalescent tree with fixed $n$\\
    \code{rphylo}&random birth--death tree with fixed $n$\\
    \code{rbdtree}&random birth--death tree with fixed
                    time and only the surviving lineages\\
    \code{rlineage}&random birth--death tree with fixed
                     time and all lineages\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent \code{rcoal}, \code{rphylo}, and \code{rbdtree} always
generate ultrametric trees (also \code{rlineage} if the death
rate is equal to zero). All functions generate fully binary trees.\footnote{The
function \code{stree} generates trees with specific shapes, including
multichotomies.}

\subsection{The function \code{rtree}}\label{sec:rtree}

We focus on the function \code{rtree} since it is the most general one
(the other functions have an underlying evolutionary model). Its
algorithm is \cite{Paradis2012}:

\begin{enumerate}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Draw randomly an integer $a$ on the interval $[1, n - 1]$. Set
  $b = n - a$.
\item If $a > 1$, apply (recursively) step 1 after substituting $n$ by
  $a$.
\item Repeat step 2 with $b$ in place of $a$.
\item Assign randomly the $n$ tip labels to the tips.
\end{enumerate}
These recursions are used to build the successive splits generating
sister-clades. This algorithm is thus well-suited to simulate rooted
trees. One of its side-effects is to produce topologies in unequal
frequencies. The reason for this is how the integer $a$ is
drawn. Suppose that $n=4$ (we detailed both the labeled and the
unlabeled cases above), then during the first iteration $a$ takes the
value 1, 2, or 3 with equal probabilities ($\frac{1}{3}$). Obviously,
if $a=2$ a balanced topology will be generated, otherwise the topology
will be unbalanced. Consequently, the expected frequencies of these
two are $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{2}{3}$ instead of $\frac{1}{2}$ and
$\frac{1}{2}$. This also does not agree with the proportions of
labeled topologies which should be $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{4}{5}$ of
the unlabeled ones.

For larger values of $n$, these expected frequencies can be calculated
in a straightforward way thanks to the recursive nature of the
algorithm. If $n=5$, there are three possible unlabeled topologies:

<<fig=true,height=3>>=
txt <- c("((,),((,),));", "(((,),(,)),);", "((((,),),),);")
TR5 <- read.tree(text = txt)
layout(matrix(1:3, 1))
for (i in 1:3) plot(TR5[[i]], "c", cex = 1.2, main = LETTERS[i])
@

\noindent During the first iteration, $a$ takes the value 1, 2, 3, or
4 with equal probabilities ($\frac{1}{4}$): $a=2$ or 3 leads to
topology A, so that it will occur in proportion $\frac{1}{2}$. On the
other hand, if $a=1$ or 4, the above reasoning for $n=4$ can be
applied so that topology B will appear in expected proportion
$\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{2}{3}=\frac{1}{3}$, and topology C in proportion
$\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{3}=\frac{1}{6}$. Since there are 105
labeled topologies with $n=5$, we skip their detailed analysis.

In \ape~5.4-1, the option \code{equiprob} was introduced to
\code{rtree} to generate topologies in equal proportions.\footnote{The
  default of this option is \code{FALSE} because several packages use
  \code{rtree()} with \code{set.seed()} in their examples.} The
modification was simple: in step~1 $a$ is drawn uniformly on
the interval $[1, \lfloor n/2 \rfloor]$. If $n=4$, $a$ now takes the
value 1 or 2 with equal probabilities ($\frac{1}{2}$), so the two
unlabeled topologies are generated in equal proportions. However, if
$n=5$, $a$ takes the same values in the same probabilities leading to
incorrect proportions: the draw $a=1$ should happen twice more
frequently than $a=2$ because the former leads to two different
topologies in the following iteration (because $b=4$) of the algorithm
whereas the latter always result in topology A. The
solution is to weigh the probabilities by the
number of possible topologies for associated to each $(a,b)$ so that those
resulting in higher number of topologies will be more likely to be
drawn. For $n=5$, the two possible pairs are $(1,4)$ and $(2,3)$;
the product of the number of unlabeled topologies gives the correct
weights:

<<>>=
howmanytrees(1, labeled = FALSE) * howmanytrees(4, labeled = FALSE)
@
<<>>=
howmanytrees(2, labeled = FALSE) * howmanytrees(3, labeled = FALSE)
@

\noindent For instance, if $n=803$ it will be necessary to calculate the
following quantity during the first iteration:

<<>>=
howmanytrees(400, labeled = FALSE) * howmanytrees(403, labeled = FALSE)
@

\noindent Section~\ref{sec:beyond} explains how these large numbers
can be handled. This scheme has been incorporated into \ape~5.5. These
probabilities are passed to the function \code{sample} and its option
\code{prob} to generate the values of $a$.

\subsection{The new function \code{rtopology}}

\ape~5.5 introduces \code{rtopology} in order to provide an
alternative to the above functions. The implemented algorithm is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Initialize an unrooted tree with $k=3$ tips. Set the number of
  branches to 3.
\item Select randomly one branch of the tree and graft onto it one
  terminal branch. Increment $k$ by 1 tip and the number of branches
  by 2.
\item Repeat step 2 until $k=n$.
\end{enumerate}
This algorithm is particularly efficient to generate unrooted trees
(this is the default of the function). A rooted tree is generated with one additional step:

\begin{enumerate}\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item[4.] Select randomly one branch of the tree and add an internal
  node on it.
\end{enumerate}

Some calculations are simplified compared to \code{rtree}: it is
possible to generate all needed random numbers at once since it is
known in advance that we will need to select among 3, 5, 7, \dots\
branches in step 2. Additionally, the tip labels are permuted at the
start of the simulation so they are added in random order during step
2. However, \code{rtree} is faster than \code{rtopology} because the
latter requires to reorder the tree edges after the simulation
algorithm is performed.

What are the expected frequencies of the different topologies under
this algorithm? Let's consider $n=4$. Step 1 generates a tree
with three terminal branches, then step 2 adds the last
terminal branch on any of these three, so that the three possible
unrooted, labeled topologies are produced with equal probabilities. The final
unrooted tree has five branches: one internal and four terminal. If
it is rooted (step 4), then the root node is added randomly on any of
these branches, therefore resulting in the balanced topology in 20\% of
the cases, and one of the unbalanced topologies in the remaining 80\%. This conforms
to the numbers of labelled topologies found above.

\subsection{Tests}

The code below is a simple example of testing the frequencies of
topologies generated by the above question considering rooted
trees with $n=4$. We first simulate 1000 trees without branch lengths
using the three algorithms detailed above:

<<>>=
TR <- list(rmtopology(1000, 4, TRUE, br = NULL),
           rmtree(1000, 4, TRUE, br = NULL),
           rmtree(1000, 4, TRUE, br = NULL, equiprob = TRUE))
@

\noindent We then build a function to extract the unique topologies
and compute their frequencies. The returned value is the $\chi^2$-test
for equal frequencies. An option controls whether to consider the
toplogies as labeled (the default) or not:

<<>>=
foo.test <- function(x, labeled = TRUE) {
    uTR <- unique(x, use.tip.label = labeled)
    f <- integer(length(uTR))
    for (j in seq_along(uTR)) {
        for (i in seq_along(x)) {
            if (all.equal(x[[i]], uTR[[j]], use.tip.label = labeled))
                f[j] <- f[j] + 1L
        }
    }
    print(f)
    chisq.test(f)
}
@

\noindent We now apply the function to the list of simulated trees.

<<>>=
lapply(TR, foo.test)
@
<<>>=
lapply(TR, foo.test, labeled = FALSE)
@

\noindent The results agree with the above analysis. The same
simulation study with $n=5$ would require larger sample sizes because
of the much larger numbers of possible topologies.

\subsection{Summary}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \code{rtree} simulates topologies in unequal frequencies. The
    differences in expected frequencies are important for small values
    of $n$ (see above for $n=4$ and $n=5$). For larger values of $n$,
    it is practically impossible to determine these frequencies because
    of the large number of possible topologies. However, it seems
    these frequencies are sufficiently low that the above analysis
    assuming equal probabilities might be a good approximation. For
    instance, \code{rmtree(1000, 20)} returns 1000 unique unlabeled
    topologies (not shown here to avoid long computations in this vignette).
  \item \code{rtree(, equiprob = TRUE)} simulates unlabeled topologies
    in equal frequencies (from \ape\ 5.5).
  \item \code{rtopology} simulated labeled topologies with equal
    probabilities. This is the function now called by \code{multi2di(,
      equiprob = TRUE)}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Enumerating Topologies Beyond Large Values}\label{sec:beyond}

The function \code{howmanytrees}, like most functions in \R, works
with double precision floating point numbers, so the largest value
which can be returned is:

<<>>=
.Machine$double.xmax
@

\noindent This value is reached with $n=151$ or 792 for labeled or unlabeled topologies, respectively:

<<>>=
howmanytrees(151)
@
<<>>=
howmanytrees(792, labeled = FALSE)
@

\noindent This section shows how larger values are handled in \ape~5.5.

\subsection{Labeled Topologies}

It is possible to write equation~\ref{eq:dblfact} using standard factorial
(this uses the fact that $2n-3$ is always an odd integer):

\begin{displaymath}
(2n-3)!!=\frac{(2n-3)!}{2^{n-2}(n-2)!}\qquad n\ge 2.
\end{displaymath}
A log-transformation of both sides leads to:

\begin{equation}
\ln[(2n-3)!!]=\ln[(2n-3)!]-(n-2)\ln 2-\ln[(n-2)!].\label{eq:dbfact}
\end{equation}
\R\ has the function \code{lfactorial} making possible to calculate
this expression with large values of $n$.\footnote{\phangorn\ has
  the function \code{ldfactorial} doing the same calculation based on
  \code{lgamma}.} Obviously, if we try to compute the exponential of
the result, we will again obtain \code{Inf}. Instead, we
can use the fact that an expression such as $a^b$ can be expressed with a power
of ten:

\begin{displaymath}
a^b=x\times 10^n,
\end{displaymath}
with $x$ a real number and $n$ an integer. We do a
log$_{10}$-transformation of both sides:

\begin{displaymath}
b\times\log_{10}a=\log_{10}x+n.
\end{displaymath}
This is solved with $n=\lfloor b\times\log_{10}a\rfloor$ and
$x=10^c$, $c=b\times\log_{10}a-n$. This can be used with
$a=\mathrm{e}$ ($\approx 2.718$) and $b=\ln[(2n-3)!!]$ calculated with
equation~\ref{eq:dbfact}.

Let's find how many possible trees there are for the number of
living species on Earth using an estimate of two million species:\footnote{This returned \code{Inf} prior to \ape~5.5.}

<<>>=
(N <- howmanytrees(2e6))
@

\noindent How many digits are needed to print this number?

<<>>=
N[2] + 1
@

\noindent How many pages to print it (assuming 3000 characters per page)?

<<>>=
ceiling((N[2] + 1) / 3000)
@

\subsection{Unlabeled Topologies}

In the unlabeled case, the formulas to calculate the number of
topologies are more complicated and do not allow the previous
approach. However, there is an almost linear relationship between $n$
and $N_n$ after log-transformation of the latter:

<<>>=
n <- 1:792
N <- howmanytrees(792, labeled = FALSE, detail = TRUE)
lN <- log10(N)
summary(lm(lN ~ n))
@

\noindent The linear approximation is good but it is still better for $n>700$:

<<>>=
s <- n > 700
summary(lm(lN[s] ~ n[s]))
@

\noindent The residuals are now almost equal to zero. We may thus write:

\begin{displaymath}
\log_{10}N_n\approx 0.3941\times n-4.153 \qquad n>792.
\end{displaymath}
Let's evaluate the quality of this approximation for a few values:

<<>>=
n <- 788:792
log10(sapply(n, howmanytrees, labeled = FALSE))
0.3941 * n - 4.153
@

\noindent The approximation is not so good for smaller values of $n$
and we use it only for $n>792$. This can be used to handle some of the
calculations detailed in Section~\ref{sec:rtree}. The coefficient
(0.3941) is actually the difference between successive values of $N_n$
on the logarithmic scale:

\begin{displaymath}
\log_{10}N_{n+1}-\log_{10}N_n=0.3941.
\end{displaymath}
This is equivalent to a ratio of these successive values equal to
$N_{n+1}/N_n=10^{0.3941}=2.477993$. We denote this last
number as $\xi$. This can help to find
an approximation of the sum of the $N_i$'s for $i=1, \dots, n$, when
$n$ is large:

\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=1}^nN_i&=N_1+N_2+N_3+\dots+N_n\\
  &\approx N_1+\xi N_1+\xi^2 N_1+\dots+\xi^{n-1} N_1\\
  &=N_1\sum_{i=1}^n\xi^{i-1}.
\end{align*}

\noindent This is a divergent geometric series ($\xi>1$). Since
$N_1=1$, this first term can be ignored. The logarithm of this sum may
be approximated using the fact that $\log(x+\delta)\approx\log(x)$ if
$x>>>\delta$. More generally, if we have a series of numbers $A$, $B$,
$C$, \dots, such that:

\begin{displaymath}
A>B>C>\dots
\end{displaymath}
then the logarithm of their sum can be approximated with successive
calculations (the base of the logarithm is unimportant):

\begin{align*}
\log(A+B+C+\dots) &\approx\log(A)\\
  &\approx\log(A+B)\\
  &\approx\log(A+B+C)\\
  &\approx\dots
\end{align*}
In other words, when calculating the logarithm of a sum, the largest
terms will contribute the most. It is possible to assess the
convergence of the successive approximations.

\begin{align*}
\log_{10}\left(\sum_{i=1}^nN_n\right)&\approx\log_{10}(\xi^{n-1})=(n-1)\log_{10}\xi\\
  &\approx\log_{10}(\xi^{n-2}+\xi^{n-1})=(n-2)\log_{10}\xi+\log_{10}(1+\xi)\\
  &\approx\log_{10}(\xi^{n-3}+\xi^{n-2}+\xi^{n-1})=(n-3)\log_{10}\xi+\log_{10}(1+\xi+\xi^2)\\
  &\approx\dots
\end{align*}
The $k$th approximation can be calculated directly with:

\begin{displaymath}
(n-k)\log_{10}\xi+\log_{10}\left(\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\xi^i\right)\qquad k>1
\end{displaymath}
This converges after a few iterations:

<<>>=
xi <- 2.477993
lxi <- log10(xi)
n <- 1000
(n - 1) * lxi # k = 1
for (k in 2:11)
    print((n - k) * lxi + log10(sum(xi^(0:(k - 1)))))
